## Information
This is a demonstration app showcasing the versatile cross-platform capabilities of Flutter. Within this application, I've integrated an API from Pexels, a renowned provider of stock photography and footage.

Operating seamlessly across Android, iOS, Web, and Windows OS, this app offers broad accessibility. Unfortunately, due to the absence of a Macbook, I couldn't conduct tests on iOS. Nevertheless, leveraging my expertise in iOS development with Flutter, I anticipate smooth functionality.

## Features
- Adaptive and responsive design, observable particularly on Web and Windows OS platforms.
- Engaging animations, including Hero Animation, enhancing the transition between screens.
- Dynamic elements like animated scale, opacity, colorful gradients, and possibly marquee texts. Some features are tailored specifically for Web and Windows OS to accommodate cursor interactions.
